  I created the website of a Nuclear Medicine practice in France, Scinti-Est. Showcasing the company's services, and guiding patients in their journey.

This website was created in part with Wordpress, providing a simple and intuitive interface for the client to update the website's content. The website is hosted on a secure server, and is optimized for SEO. It offers a guided experience for patients, allowing them to find the information they need quickly and easily, requesting an appointment, and finding the practices's locations. It also redirect to the patient result portal, created by me and my team as well in my work at Ether Healthcare.
