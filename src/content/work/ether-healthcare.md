As a partner in Ether Healthcare, I had the opportunity to create the startup's landing page. Utilizing key technologies like React for interactive user interfaces, Framer Motion for web animations and transitions, and Docker for secure deployment, I was able to design a functional and engaging landing page.

To foster continuous communication, a live chat feature with offline mode was integrated. The aesthetics of the page were carefully crafted using Photoshop, aligning with the brand's image.

This landing page showcase the company's services, which I work on as a Product Owner.
